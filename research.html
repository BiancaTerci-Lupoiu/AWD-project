                <h3>The Role of Dancing in the Educational Process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dance can enhance physical, cognitive, and emotional development in
                        students. It combines movement with learning, fostering creativity and self-expression.</li>
                    <li>Dancing can make the integration between a person's body, mind and soul. The person does not
                        exist without a body revealing its soul and the soul can not exist if it
                        does not express itself through the body.</li>
                    <li>Dance supports a holistic approach to education by addressing multiple aspects of
                        development (physical, mental, emotional, social) simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Dance promotes emotional expression and can be a way of releasing stress and tension. It
                        encourages teamwork, communication, and the development of social skills through group
                        performances and collaborations.</li>
                    <li>Dancing helps improve motor skills, visual-spatial coordination, balance, and overall physical
                        fitness.</li>
                    <li>Through dancing children can acquire concepts about space and orientation (front/back,
                        right/left, near/far) and develop notions about time and rhythmic structure and rhythmic sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>We can not know much of our body if we do not move it.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Learning through physical action and observation, exemplified by dance, is a powerful and
                        essential educational tool.</li>
                    <li>This method of learning is supported by the brain's action
                        observation network which activates both when we observe and when we perform actions.</li>
                    <li>The integration of physical learning in education will stimulate creativity, increase
                        motivation, and social intelligence, moving beyond a solely cognitive approach to a more
                        holistic understanding of human development.</li>

                <h3>Why Do We Dance?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dance arises from natural human movements, like walking, but is differentiated by rhythm and an
                        aesthetic quality.</li>
                    <li>Rhythm is inherent to human life (e.g., heartbeat, breathing) and the universe, as seen in the
                        cycles of nature, it reduces mental effort by creating automaticity in movements, which has
                        practical applications in labor and group activities.</li>
                    <li>Dancing is a physical expression of heightened emotions such as joy, fear, anger, or love and it
                        serves to amplify or evoke emotions through physical movement.</li>
                    <li>Based on their psychological and social motivations, there are 3 categories of dances:
                        <ul id="inner-list">
                            <li>Religious dances: for worship, spiritual ecstasy, or to connect with the divine.</li>
                            <li>War dances: to intimidate enemies or inspire aggression and unity among participants.
                            </li>
                            <li>Profane dances: focused on courtship and social interaction, often reflecting societal
                                attitudes toward morality and propriety.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>History: In earlier periods, dance served as part of religious or sacred rituals across
                        cultures, often tied to religion, fertility, and communal celebration. Examples include:
                        <ul id="inner-list1">
                            <li>The sacred dances of ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome.</li>
                            <li>Medieval funeral dances, symbolizing the tension between life and death.</li>
                            <li>Renaissance and Baroque-era social dances that reflected societal hierarchies and
                                decorum.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Dance is driven by the instinct for life, a response to death, and the need for societal
                        cohesion linking the physical to the cosmic.</li>

                <h3>Dance and the brain: a review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dancing helps the brain stay flexible and adaptable, thanks to its mix of movement, music, and
                        emotions. When people train in dance for a long time, their brains physically change to support
                        better control of movement, balance, and spatial awareness.
                        <ul id="inner-list2">
                            <li>For expert dancers, certain parts of the brain involved in hearing and controlling
                                movement grow stronger and thicker.</li>
                            <li>Another part of the brain, the corpus callosum, which helps the two sides of the brain
                                work together, becomes better connected. This makes communication between the left and
                                right sides of the brain faster and more efficient.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Dance training strengthens the brain's auditory-motor integration, crucial for syncing
                        movement to music. EEG (Electroencephalography) studies show that expressive movements generate
                        distinct neural patterns, which could be decoded using machine learning algorithms, revealing
                        the emotional intent behind movements.</li>
                    <li>
                        Dance-based therapy shows promise for:
                        <ul id="inner-list3">
                            <li>Parkinson disease: Tango and other dance interventions improve mobility, balance, and
                                symptom severity.</li>
                            <li>Autism and psychiatric conditions: Dance therapy provides emotional regulation and
                                social interaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Dancers and musicians develop distinct brain adaptations suited to their training because dance
                        combines artistic creativity with athletic precision, differentiating it from other forms of
                        physical training. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Dance offers health benefits similar to traditional exercises like jogging or swimming, but with
                        added fun and creativity, making it easier to sustain as a regular activity.</li>
                    <li>The side-to-side movements in dance strengthen weight-bearing bones (e.g., femur, tibia) and
                        improve muscle tone and posture but also increases flexibility.</li>
                    <li>Dance boosts activity in brain regions responsible for memory, multitasking, planning, and
                        attention. Memorizing routines and working with a partner challenges the brain, helping it stay
                        sharp and adaptable over time.</li>
                    <li>In a 21-year study cited in the article, they discovered that individuals of 75 years old who
                        engaged in reading, dancing, playing board games, and playing a musical instrument once a week
                        had a 7% lower risk for developing dementia. Those who participated in these activities at least
                        11 times per month reduced their risk of dementia by 63%.</li>
                    <li>
                        Dance therapy is tailored for individuals with physical or psychological limitations, helping
                        manage stress and improve mental and physical health. It is effective in treating:

                    </li>
                    <li>Dance is found in every culture, making it something that connects people all around the
                        world. It shows how dance can bring people together and be a simple, enjoyable way to express
                        yourself and stay active.</li>

                            <li>N/um, a spiritual power stored in the pit of the stomach, is "heated" through rhythmic

                                !kia, a transcendental state where the healer connects with the spiritual world.
                                Reaching !kia is a physically intense and emotionally challenging process, requiring the
